# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository is part of the ALX Front-End curriculum.  
It demonstrates how to set up a basic Next.js project using TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS, without using the `src` directory or the App Router.  
The purpose of this repo is to provide a clean, scalable, and easy-to-understand foundation for building modern web applications.
